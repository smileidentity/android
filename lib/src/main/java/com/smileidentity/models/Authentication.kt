/**
 * The Auth Smile request. Auth Smile serves multiple purposes:
 * - It is used to fetch the signature needed for subsequent API requests
 * - It indicates the type of job that will being performed
 * - It is used to fetch consent information for the partner
 *
 * @param jobType The type of job that will be performed
 * @param enrollment Whether or not this is an enrollment job
 * @param country The country code of the country where the job is being performed. This value is
 * required in order to get back consent information for the partner
 * @param idType The type of ID that will be used for the job. This value is required in order to
 * get back consent information for the partner
 * @param updateEnrolledImage Whether or not the enrolled image should be updated with image
 * submitted for this job
 * @param jobId The job ID to associate with the job. Most often, this will correspond to a unique
 * Job ID within your own system. If not provided, a random job ID will be generated
 * @param userId The user ID to associate with the job. Most often, this will correspond to a unique
 * User ID within your own system. If not provided, a random user ID will be generated
 * @param signature Whether or not to fetch the signature for the job
 * @param production Whether or not to use the production environment
 * @param partnerId The partner ID
 * @param authToken The auth token from smile_config.json
